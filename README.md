# Aave Polygon Governance Bridge

This repo contains the smart contracts and related code for bridging Aave governance-v2 contracts on Ethereum to the Polygon network in order to make to execute desired updates on the Polygon Network.

## Architecture

The BridgeExecutor contract is the focus of this repo.

![aave-polygon-governance-bridge-architecture](./PolygonBridgeExecutorArchitecture.png)

## Setup

- Clone the repo
- run `npm install`

Follow the next steps to setup the repository:

- Install `docker` and `docker-compose`
- Create an enviroment file named `.env` and fill out the environment variables per `example.env`

## Running in Docker

Terminal Window 1
`docker-compose up`

Once Terminal Window 1 Loaded - in a seperate terminal window - Terminal Window 2: 
`docker-compose exec contracts-env bash`

In Terminal Window 2, run desired scripts from npm package file (i.e `npm run compile`)

## Available Scripts

### Compile

`npm run compile`

This will compile the available smart contracts.

### Test / Coverage

`npm run hardhat test` / `npm run hardhat coverage`

Run an end to end test of these contracts on an Ethereum mainnet fork. This makes the assumption that all contracts are on Ethereum, which is an inaccurate assumption but helps for testing smart contract functionality in one script.

The two assumption required to make this possible are:
1. Add a Call in the `CustomPolygonMapping` Contract. This way, rather than just emitting an event, and having a function called on Polygon, the receiver will be called directly with this function on the forked Eth Network.
2. In the `AavePolygonGovernanceReceiver` the access control require statedment in the first line of onStateReceive must be commented out.

### Execute Testnet Script

`npm run hardhat:goerli simulate-governance`

Assumes a `contractAddresses.json` file exists with all necessary contracts deployed and addresses with appropriate funding

The script will:

1. Create a proposal and wait for the voting to start (Proposal triggers a cross-chain message on execution)
2. Vote on the proposal and wait for the voting to end
3. Queue Vote and wait until execution time
4. Execute proposal
5. Monitor the Polygon Bridge for a queueing event
6. Try to immediately execute the transaction - Fail
7. Wait until execution time
8. Execute ActionsSet
9. Confirm expected Polygon state update

### Bridge Contracts Functionality
- The proposal is an encoded function call to the function `sendMessageToChild()` in `FxRoot`. The calldata for this proposal contains two encoded variables:
  - The first variable is the address of the contract that will decode and process this message on the Polygon chain. In this case, the receiver is the BridgeExecutor contract address.
  - The second variable is the data that will be decoded on the polygon chain. This field contains encoded bytes for the following fields targets[], values[], signatures[], calldatas[], and withDelegatecall[] 
- When the proposal is executed, `sendMessageToChild()` in the `FxRoot` triggers `syncState()` on the `StateSender` contract which emits a StateSync event
- Validators listening for this StateSync even then trigger the `onStateReceived()` in the `FxChild` contract. The `FxRoot` contract is mapped to the `FxChild` through the `StateSender` contract.
- In `onStateReceived` the encoded data is passed along to a contract that implements the function `processMessageFromRoot` - which in this case is the `BridgeExecutor` contract. In `processMessageFromRoot` the BridgeExecutor calls `queue()` to queue the proposed actions for the appropriate execution time

## Deploying the Bridge Executor

- `delay` - the time required to pass after the ActionsSet is queued, before execution
- `gracePeriod` - once execution time passes, you can execute this until the grace period ends
- `minimumDelay` - if the delay is updated by the guardian, it cannot be less than this minimum
- `maximumDelay` - if the delay is updated by the guardian, it cannot be more than this maximum
- `fxRootSender` - the address that can send messages to this BridgeExecutor through the FxPortal. For Aave-Governance-V2 it is the executor contract.- `fxChild` - the fxChild contract from the FxPortal
- `guardian` - the admin address of this contract with the permission to cancel ActionsSets and update the delay value

## Dependencies

### FxPortal

This repo uses the FxPortal developed and designed by the Polygon team

https://github.com/jdkanani/fx-portal

### Trigger Contracts

This repo uses Aave-Governance-V2 tor trigger transactions through the BridgeExecutor in this repo. Any contract can trigger these transactions, however the address of the triggering contract should be set as the `fxRootSender` in the `BridgeExecutor` contract to enforce that only this contract can queue actions in the `BridgeExecutor`


## Additional Available Tasks

- `get-info` - this will print current chain info: ChainId, Current Block, Balance of a hardcoded address
- `print-default-wallets` - print the wallets available based on the .env secrets
- `deploy` - generic deployment task
- `verify` - verifies contract on Etherscan
- `verify-template` - template verification helper

Note:

When using the tasks through `npm run hardhat <taskname>` if you are including options you will need to include and extra -- prior to the task options. Example of task with options:

```
npm run hardhat deploy -- --contract Greeter --printparams
```

### deploy

Usage: hardhat [GLOBAL OPTIONS] deploy --contract <STRING> --libraries <STRING> --librariesfile <STRING> --params <STRING> --paramsfile <STRING> [--printparams] --signer <STRING> [--verify]

OPTIONS:

  --contract     	Name of contract to deploy
  --libraries    	json as string mapping of libraries to address
  --librariesfile	file containing mapping of libraries to address
  --params       	JSON string of contract params - defaults to CLI
  --paramsfile   	Path to a TS file with params defined as default export
  --printparams  	Print constructor params
  --signer       	Define signer - private key(pk), mnemonic(mn), defender(ozd) - defaults to ethers signer
  --verify       	Verify contract on Etherscan

deploy: deploy contract - add contract name and params as arguements

The parameters for the contract constructor can be set four different ways:
1. use the option `--params` as a stringified JSON
2. use the option `--paramsfile` to define the path to a ts file that has the parameters as the default export
2. hardcode the params as a JSON in the contractparams variable in the deploy task
    - you can use the --printparams option to get a template JSON of the params to copy and paste into the script and fill out 
3. use the cli. By not setting contractparams you can 

To include the contract params as a string, pay close attentions to the quotations used to create the stringified JSON object. Below is a working example:

```
npm run hardhat deploy -- --contract Greeter --params '{"_greeting": "asdf","_testNumber": 12, "_testAddress": "0x3619DbE27d7c1e7E91aA738697Ae7Bc5FC3eACA5"}'
```

Example using --paramsfile
```
npm run hardhat deploy -- --contract Greeter --paramsfile ./greeterParams.ts
```

## verify-template

Usage: hardhat [GLOBAL OPTIONS] verify-template --contract <STRING> --contractaddress <STRING> --libraries <STRING> --librariesfile <STRING> --params <STRING> --paramsfile <STRING> [--printparams]

OPTIONS:

  --contract       	Name of contract to deploy
  --contractaddress	Address of deployed contract to verify
  --libraries      	json as string mapping of libraries to address
  --librariesfile  	file containing mapping of libraries to address
  --params         	JSON string of contract params - defaults to CLI
  --paramsfile     	Path to a TS file with params defined as default export
  --printparams    	Print constructor params

verify-template: verify contract on etherscan

This wraps the default 'verify' task to enable some flexibility in how params and libraries are provided.
